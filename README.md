# Phonebook_Application_byJava
Not an intelligent but an effective Phonebook by Java. As a beginner it took me almost 4 hours to complete. Has a minimal number of features with smooth loading transitions. Rather than representing an ideal phonebook application it represents the thinking of mine with basic knowledge of programming. Hope this project will impress you.
